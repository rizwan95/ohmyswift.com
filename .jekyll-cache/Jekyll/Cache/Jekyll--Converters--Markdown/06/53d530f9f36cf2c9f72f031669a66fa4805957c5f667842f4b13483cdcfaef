I" <p>Almost every iOS developer would have had to make a network call from their app. Swift uses URLSession to make network calls. URLSessionTask includes DataTask, UploadTask, DownloadTask, and WebsocketTask (WebsocketTask is lately introduced in iOS13.0 check <a href="/blog/2019/08/31/introducing-urlsessionwebsockettask-native-websocket-implementation-using-swift-5/">this article</a> to know more about it.)
I was testing a multipart data request API using the [Postman app.]<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">https://www.getpostman.com/</a> The API worked, the file got uploaded, and the results came in.
However, I needed to write the Swift code to make a multipart request from the iOS app.
Writing code for data task can be simple, but the complexity increases when we write code for multipart requests. I was wondering whether Postman can generate the multipart data request code for me, turns out that it could!</p>
