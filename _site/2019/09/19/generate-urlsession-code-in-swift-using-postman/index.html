<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/postman-swift.png" alt="Generate Swift code using Postman" /></p>

<p>After you had entered the API endpoint details like URL, query params, request body, and request headers hit the “code” button.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/postman-main-screen.png" alt="Postman main screeen" /></p>

<p>Select Swift as the programming language, and you will be able to see the Swift code for the request.
Neat, isn’t it? The generated code comes in very handy for developers and saves much time. Of course, we have to modify the code here and there to suit our needs, but it saves much time!</p>
