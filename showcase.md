There are so many things that go into the development and deployment of software. We decided to showcase the apps created by indie and new developers in our website. By doing so, we believe that we are giving back to the community. Download their apps and support them. Do you want to get featured on our website? Contact us [here](/blog/social). (We don't charge for showcasing the apps. We will showcase the apps only if they meet our quality checks.)
